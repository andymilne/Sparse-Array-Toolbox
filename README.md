# Sparse Array Toolbox

For sparse data, sparse formats can significantly increase speed and reduce memory requirements. However, MATLAB’s built-in sparse format represents only vectors and matrices. This toolbox contains a new sparse array structure and associated operations – outer, entrywise, and inner products, addition, summation, convolution, permutation, (circular) shifts, and distance measures – that can be applied to sparse representations of N-dimensional arrays. All functions have been carefully designed to optimize speed.

See SparseArrayToolbox.pdf for more information.
